# Leek Wars
An attempt at making a somewhat competitive AI for [Leek Wars](http://leekwars.com).

## Current features
* Multiple chip awareness, with priority list
* Basic movement
* Best weapon calculation
* Basic healing (broken in most situations)

## To be implemented
* Better enemy awareness
  * Weapons
  * Chips
* Take into account all damage sources to calculate best throughoutput
* Terrain awareness, using objects to protect itself
* Battle simulations for heuristics
* Merge moving and attacking as actions, and use an action tree instead
* Balance heals now that better chips are available
* Detect enemy play style and actually learn from it
